    <h1>About The SkyWay1000 Minecraft Server</h1>
    <p>"SkyWay1000" Was Originally A Server That Got Wiped, Then An Unknown Amount Of Time Later The
      <br>
      Owner Of It "&Ntilde;atick" Remade It As A World, Then Put It On The Server, But With It Being
      <br>
      Called "SkyWays", Which Is Why It Is Most Commonly Called "SkyWays" And Says SkyWays In-Game
      <br>
      And On Q&A Live Streams. Also This All Happened In 2020 And Started On 1.16.3.
      <br>
      A Long While After The 1.16.4 Release I Decided To Update It After It Had Had Multiple Issues
      <br>
      Updating, And It Worked, Alot After That I Moved It Onto 1.17 Then 1.18.1 What It Is Running
      <br>
      At The Moment With Bedrock And Java Support And Multiple Game Modes But Is Currently Whitelisted.
